PURPOSE OF THE WEBSITE
The website that has been developed is an interactive and educational resource that provides faculty, students, and non-students seeking information on the University of Ghana Computer Science Department with ten pages of insight. It has one globally linked file and ten.html files that correspond to the pages. CSS that gives the website a good degree of design and interactivity. 

The various pages of the website that were created are;

Photos and movies stored in different folders were used to construct every page on this website.  Enough links, such the one to the map and the C.S.S. file including all of their styles. Pages and registration are further features of the website that was made.
 Throughout the period of creating this website, the timeline was regularly uploaded to a github repository that was ‘forked’ from Daquiver1/DCIT_205_IA, named 11260708_DCIT205.

What I have learnt from the project.

I've learned the value of preparation and planning thanks to this endeavor. You need to gather enough information before starting a website, including images, videos, links, and background knowledge on the topic of your website. This improves the operation of your website because it will be easier to accomplish your objectives and appeal to your target audience when you plan ahead and prepare. 

The process of creating this project also made me realize that I still have a lot to learn about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and that the best resources for web developers are online resources and other seasoned professionals in the industry.
In summary, this project has taught me some very important lessons, like the need for proper planning, design, technical expertise, and ongoing development, in order to create a successful website.
