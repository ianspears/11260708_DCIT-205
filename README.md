What I have learnt from the project.

I've learned the value of preparation and planning thanks to this endeavor. You need to gather enough information before starting a website, including images, videos, links, and background knowledge on the topic of your website. This improves the operation of your website because it will be easier to accomplish your objectives and appeal to your target audience when you plan ahead and prepare. 

The process of creating this project also made me realize that I still have a lot to learn about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and that the best resources for web developers are online resources and other seasoned professionals in the industry.
In summary, this project has taught me some very important lessons, like the need for proper planning, design, technical expertise, and ongoing development, in order to create a successful website.
